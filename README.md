# README

This application is called The Fish Store and is used by TheFishStore, LLC to display fish that are available at their store. It uses a card/tile style display to display the fish.  The cards have a video that show the fish that way the user is able to see what the fish would look like in a fish tank. The cards also have the ability to rotate between the display information and a full description.

The Fish Store application can be accessed through the index.html file.

The application uses the fish-project-api, which must be running on an active server in order to receive the database information and populate the application with fish. API database can be accessed through "servername"/fish or "servername"/categories.  Those with access to database can view Contact Us messages through the "servername"/messages.
